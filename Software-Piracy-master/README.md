# Software-Piracy
The Objective of this project is to build an application that can be used to ameliorate software piracy with the help of Ethereum network which is based on blockchain technology using smart contract.
This repository handles the server part of this system.
Anti-Piracy-Software :
This is the Software Part of anti piracy system. The software is a game (https://github.com/hexadeciman/Snake) with anti-piracy codes embedded in it. It runs on the client side. It is initially dependant on the server but later is independent of it and instead depends only on blockchain. In this project, ropsten testnet is used. It is installed in the system using the setup: https://github.com/ParadoxTwo/Anti-Piracy-Setup
Other part i.e Anti-Piracy-Setup:
This is the installer for anti-piracy system. It is completely dependent on the server: https://github.com/ayushijain249/Software-Piracy and it is also indirectly dependent on: https://github.com/ParadoxTwo/Anti-Piracy-Software
